When the [model](index.md) is time invariant (which also implies that we donâ€™t have missing values), it is usually much more efficient to use the Chandrasekhar recursions, which propagate the differences of the covariance matrix:

$$ \Delta P_t = - L_t M_t^{-1} L_t' $$

If we write:

$$ K_t = T P_t Z' $$ 

$$ F_t = Z P_t Z' + H $$

the CKMS recursions are:

$$  \Delta K_t = -T L_t M_t^{-1} L_t' Z'$$    

$$  \Delta F_t = -Z L_t M_t^{-1} L_t' Z'$$    

$$ L_{t+1} = \left( T - K_t F_t^{-1}Z \right) L_t$$  

$$ \Delta M_t = - Z L_t F_t^{-1} L_t'Z'$$  

It is clear that if we can take $M_0 = F_0$ (see below for stationary models with their unconditional initial distribution), the last equation is redundant ( $M_t=F_t$ ). Then, the recursions are 

$$  \Delta K_t = -T L_t F_t^{-1} L_t' Z'$$    

$$  \Delta F_t = -Z L_t F_t^{-1} L_t' Z'$$    

$$ L_{t+1} = \left( T - K_t F_t^{-1}Z \right) L_t$$  

In the case of stationary models, the usual (unconditional) distribution of the state is defined by the relationship:

$$ P_* = T P_* T' + V $$  

So, we have:

$$ \Delta P_0 = P_0 - P_* = T P_* T' - K_0 F_0^{-1} K_0' + V - P_* = - K_0 F_0^{-1} K_0'$$

and we can take:

$$ L_0 = K_0, \: M_0 = F_0 $$  

It can be shown that the CKMS algorithm is also valid for non-stationary models, after their initialization period.
